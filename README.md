## Overview

- This application was built to consolidate Third Party APIs knowledge;

  - A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day

  - Runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery

## Acceptance Criteria

The app functionality:

- Displays the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner

- Presents timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down

- Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed

- Allows a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

- Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock

- Persist events between refreshes of a page

- Uses a date utility library to work with date and time
